Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which 
algorithms are written in terms of types to-be-specified-later 
that are then instantiated when needed for specific types provided 
as parameters.

interface types in Go are a form of generic programming. 
They let us capture the common aspects of different types 
and express them as methods. We can then write functions that 
use those interface types, and those functions will work for 
any type that implements those methods.
